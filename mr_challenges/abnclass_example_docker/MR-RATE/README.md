# **MR-RATE: A Vision-Language Foundation Model and Dataset for Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

Welcome to the official repository for MR-RATE, a pioneering vision-language model and 3D medical imaging dataset for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

## Overview

**MR-RATE** is a unified framework for **vision-language modeling in brain and spine MRI**, comprising a large-scale 3D medical imaging dataset that uniquely pairs textual data with brain and spine MRI volumes and a contrastive pretraining pipeline that aligns multi-sequence MRI volumes with radiology reports using VL-CABS loss.

| **Data Preprocessing**      | End-to-end pipeline converting raw DICOM exports into clean, anonymized, and spatially standardized NIfTI volumes. Covers DICOM-to-NIfTI conversion, PACS metadata filtering, modality classification, binary brain segmentation & defacing, co-registration to a shared T1w reference, atlas registration to MNI152 space, and multi-label anatomical segmentations. Also includes the radiology report preprocessing pipeline (anonymization, translation, structuring, QC) and LLM-based pathology classification producing binary labels for 37 SNOMED CT-grounded pathologies. Includes standalone scripts for downloading and merging all MR-RATE Hugging Face repositories. |
| **Contrastive Pretraining** | Contrastive vision-language model that aligns multi-sequence MRI volumes and radiology reports using VL-CABS loss. Uses a VJEPA2 (ViT-G) image encoder with LoRA fine-tuning and a BiomedVLP-CXR-BERT text encoder. Supports four multi-volume fusion modes (`early`, `mid_cnn`, `late`, `late_attn`) and three image spaces (`native_space`, `coreg_space`, `atlas_space`). Enables zero-shot brain MRI pathology classification at inference time. |

## Workflow Summary

1. **Download preprocessed data** directly from [MR-RATE on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forithmus/MR-RATE) (see `data-preprocessing/` for preprocessing details)
2. **Train the contrastive model** on (multi-sequence MRI, radiology report) pairs using `contrastive-pretraining/`
4. **Run zero-shot inference** for brain MRI pathology classification using trained model weights and `contrastive-pretraining/`

## Related Foundation Models

The MR-RATE dataset was used by NVIDIA to train [NV-Generate-MR-Brain](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Generate-MR-Brain), a 3D latent diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, high-resolution synthetic brain MRI volumes for T1, Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), T2, and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI). This model is available under the permissive NVIDIA Open Model License, enabling researchers and developers to adapt it for their own downstream medical AI applications.
